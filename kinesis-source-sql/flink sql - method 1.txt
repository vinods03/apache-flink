Summary:

There is a raw table with kinesis connector and a processed table with filesystem connector.
Multiple challenges / errors faced, but the main issue seems to be that the insert statement that loads from raw to processed table behaves unpredictably, sometimees continues to run and sometimes fails (probably when no data is there to process in raw table ?). Even the select statements were going through fine someetimes and sometimes failing.
Mutiple hops resulting in multiple points of failure.

Later, i found that there were a lot of data issues in the source files FUTURES_TRADES.txt that is used to push data into kinesis data stream.
There were unexpected commas, missing characters, the special character for Carriage Return etc.
I cleaned it up manually.
Also changed date format from 2000/01/01 to 2000-01-01. This was probably not required.
After doing all the above changes, i really did not test out the steps listed below.
However, anyway, flink sql - method 2 is more efficient.
